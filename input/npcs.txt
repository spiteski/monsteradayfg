Selachian ruthlessness is well known among coastal and aquatic communities. Raiding parties wash like waves over sand castles, leaving destruction in their wake, before disappearing back into the sea.Selachian Settlements. Most commonly found in the cold northern regions of the world, Selachian settlements are built in coral reefs, rocky coasts or underwater cliffs bordering a deep abyss. Unlike the rival merfolk, Selachians care little for the passage of time, often living for years without interaction with the outside world. Selachians tend to delve into the darkest parts of the ocean, hunting in packs to track down and kill larger prey. They come to the surface to raid ships and nearby settlements to collect more materials for their homes. Selachians defend themselves with weapons taken from pirating or crafted from whatever materials were salvaged from shipwrecks, beaches, and dead undersea creatures.Hired Muscle. Often, pirating crews or desperate merchants will hire a pair of Selachians to work for them. Money does little to inspire a Selachian, but promise of fresh blood or an epic prize will keep a Selachian in check for a time. Bought more for their brawn than brain, Selachians find their place as bodyguards or thugs, their bulky forms not well suited for nimble work.Pirates who convince these beasts to ship with them employ their strength as living grappling lines and frontline warriors. Sent to board the enemy ship first, Selachians fall into bloody frenzies, leaving behind a wake of destruction until either alone or killed.Biggest Prize. Selachian communities believe in constantly outdoing one another. At birth, two Selachians are paired. For the rest of their lives, these Selachians wage a constant battle, heavily prompted by the community, to bring back the greatest prize. Often this prize is a kill or trophy but can also be feats of unlikely success. If a Selachian dies from this competition, their partner attempts to fulfill the pact for the other, marking it as the greatest prize they could achieve.Mortal Enemies. Selachians and merf olk are mortal enemies. Years of raiding, destruction and war have carved a rift between the two species. Selachians also cannot abide merrow, who remind them too much of their less abyssal kin. SliverMedium monstrosity (sliver), neutral evilArmor Class 12Hit Points 22 (4d8 + 4)Speed 30 ft.STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 14 (+2) 15 (+2) 12 (+1) 11 (+0) 12 (+1) 8 (-1)Skills Perception +3Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13Languages Sliver (see Hive Mind)Challenge 1/2 (100 XP)Hive Mind.
