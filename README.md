# Monster A Day Fantasy Grounds module
Fantasy Grounds module updated regularly for the fantastic Monster A Day as seen on Reddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/monsteraday

A thread on the Fantasy Grounds boards has been created as a request for contributors.

We will be using Zeus's PAR5E to create and update the module as updates occur. All monster stats should be entered in input/npcs.txt in the format specified for NPC parsing in the the PAR5E documentation located in the app download link here: http://www.drzeuss.co.uk/fantasy-grounds/utilities-tools/

## How to contribute

If you are familiar with git and contributing through GitHub, then working on this project should be simple and familiar. If you are not, but still want to contribute, please PM me on the Github or the Fantasy Grounds boards. I'm sturtus there as well.

### NPC stats
Add entries in the input/npcs.txt file using the format specified in the PAR5E documentation.

### Tokens
Add tokens with clear lowercase names in the input/tokens folder. Each token should use the base template pog_base01.psd.

TBD: resolution.

### Images and portraits
NPC images should be uploaded to input/images. These should not be the monster imagery from the Monster A Day reddit thread, as we do not have permission from any of the artists. Originals only, cropped to only include the monster image.
